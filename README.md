# Css To The Rescue  
In this Readme you will find:
* The process documented by week
* My findings
* A link to my recourse file

## Week I
In this week i started to look what my beginning skills are with css and looking into what i wanted to improve in.
On the first day i made a beginning for my concept. A simple dating site, with a login page. The idea is a webapp like tinder. You can rate a picture and if you rate them high enough you can chat with hem.
I made a begging on design(see the sketch file)
Because i didn't have any exercise on css grid i did a course on it (http://cssgridgarden.com/). After i successfully passed it i dit put my new skill to the test. I tried made a login screen in css grid and after some try and error i successfully made it work.
I also looked into css variables because i only had experience in sass variables

A made the exercise to put the techniques from the book to use in my second branch(css-secrets).


### Planing for week 2
* Make big process on the css
* Looking into techniques for accessibility


## Week II

## Week III
